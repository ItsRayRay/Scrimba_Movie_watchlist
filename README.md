This is my sixth project created while following the Scrimba learning path, a movie watchlist web application that allows users to search for movies using the TMDB API and store them as a watchlist in local storage.

The project was an opportunity for me to build on my API and local storage skills, which I had developed in previous projects. I learned how to make more  API calls to retrieve data on movies, and how to store that data in local storage.

The movie watchlist interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a search bar for finding movies and a display area for showing movie details. Users can add movies to their watchlist.

Overall, this project helped me to further develop my skills in API calls and local storage management.
